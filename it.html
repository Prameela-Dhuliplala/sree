Information Technology was started in the year 2000 as one of the programs under the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of CBIT.
 A separate and full-fledged IT department was necessitated by the increasing differentiation between the tasks addressed by computer science and Information Technology professionals. The full-fledged Department of Information Technology was started in the year 2004 and currently has two sections for the under graduate program with an intake of 120 students per annum.
